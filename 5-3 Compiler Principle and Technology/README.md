# Lexer
This project is a simple lexer to analyze token stream based on DFA.  

# LL1 parser
It is an exciting attempt to utilize Python to create parser.With basic data structures like dictionary in Pythonm, it is easy to implement LL1 parse list and LL1 stack.

What's more, I try to create some useful tools such as a script to get First-Set and Follow-Set for LL analysis.

# LR parser
The same, I use Python to create Augmented grammer, First-and-Follow Set, DFA, LR Goto-Table and LR Action-Table.

These projects are the first use fo Python to prepare larger programs.

# Ideas
Some additional ideas about LR error recovery and prioritization scheme.
